# Pok√©dex

Pok√©dex NFC is a mobile app built with Flutter that brings Pok√©mon cards to life using NFC technology. By simply tapping a Pok√©mon card (embedded with an NFC tag) to their phone, users can instantly view detailed information about the Pok√©mon featured on the card.

### üîç How It Works
- Each Pok√©mon card is paired with an NFC chip containing a unique identifier.
- When a user taps the card to their NFC-enabled phone, the app reads the chip.
- The app then displays the Pok√©mon‚Äôs profile, including image, type, stats, and more‚Äîjust like a real Pok√©dex.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Built with Flutter for cross-platform support
- Instant Pok√©mon recognition via NFC scan

### üß† Ideal For
- Fans looking for an interactive Pok√©dex experience
- Educational or gamified card-based experiences
